# Tuesday Week39 (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the HIV infection in a dentist paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### 1. The HIV infection paper

You should read this paper before Monday class:

CHIN-YIH OU, CAROL A. CIESIELSKI, GERALD MYERS, CLAUDIU I. BANDEA, CHI-CHENG LUO, BETTE T. M. KORBER, JAMES I. MULLINS, GERALD SCHOCHETMAN, RUTH L. BERKELMAN, A. NIKKI ECONOMOU, JOHN J. WITTE, LAWRENCE J. FURMAN, GLEN A. SATTEN, KERSTI A. MACLNNES, JAMES W. CURRAN, HAROLD W. JAFFE, LABORATORY INVESTIGATION GROUP, EPIDEMIOLOGIC INVESTIGATION GROUP. [Molecular Epidemiology of HIV Transmission in a Dental Practice](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/256/5060/1165). SCIENCE. 22 MAY 1992 : 1165-1171

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gnwNQYFoR81MLwLDy7PEywTHFflZRhyZmVeZPGOFDq0/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions and they will have to write the answer that we all come up with.
