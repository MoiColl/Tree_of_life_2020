# Tuesday Week39

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the HIV infection in a dentist paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### The HIV infection paper

You should read this paper before Tuesday class:

CHIN-YIH OU, CAROL A. CIESIELSKI, GERALD MYERS, CLAUDIU I. BANDEA, CHI-CHENG LUO, BETTE T. M. KORBER, JAMES I. MULLINS, GERALD SCHOCHETMAN, RUTH L. BERKELMAN, A. NIKKI ECONOMOU, JOHN J. WITTE, LAWRENCE J. FURMAN, GLEN A. SATTEN, KERSTI A. MACLNNES, JAMES W. CURRAN, HAROLD W. JAFFE, LABORATORY INVESTIGATION GROUP, EPIDEMIOLOGIC INVESTIGATION GROUP. [Molecular Epidemiology of HIV Transmission in a Dental Practice](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/256/5060/1165). SCIENCE. 22 MAY 1992 : 1165-1171

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gnwNQYFoR81MLwLDy7PEywTHFflZRhyZmVeZPGOFDq0/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions and they will have to write the answer that we all come up with.

Do you want to know more about the case? [Here](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/weekinreview/aids-and-a-dentist-s-secrets.html) is an article from the New York Times explaining the case, the multiple theories and what was believed at that time (June 6, 1993). You can also find more info about [David J. Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Acer) and patient A, [Kimberly Bergalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Bergalis). Furthemore, you can find other [publications](https://www.nature.com/articles/4808632) suporting the idea that David J. Acer intentionally infected their patients...

*to 'express a vendetta' against the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The scientist said Acer's principal motive was to seek revenge against the health agencies he believed infected homosexuals with AIDS during an experimental hepatitis B vaccination program in the 1970s.*
