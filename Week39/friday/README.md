# Friday Week39 (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

## Work plan


This week we are going to learn how to create and manipulate phylogenetic trees in R with the package `ape`. For that, a basic understanding of R is required as well as installing R in your machines. I'll poste here some tutorials in case you need to learn basic R and links to where you can find R and R studio downloads. 

### 1. R installation and tutorials

In this section, I'll post to some useful links to download, install and learn R. You don't need to follow this if you have a basic understanding of R. If you need to learn R, I recomend that you do little by little. For this week, you won't need to code in R yourself. Thus, I recomend that you space tutorials between this sesion and next and learn R gradually. 

1. Downloading and installing R and R studio

    This [link](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) contains lots of useful material to both install and learn R. Start clicking on the [R](https://cloud.r-project.org) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) in the previous link (or the ones I provide), download and install both in your machine. 




2. Open MEGAX and import this data to MEGAX. This can be easily done dragging the file to the main MEGAX window or cliking on the **DATA** button. 
3. Click **MODELS** on the main MEGAX window and click **Find Best DNA/Protein Models (ML)...**
