# Friday Week39 (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

## Work plan


This week we are going to learn how to create and manipulate phylogenetic trees in R with the package `ape`. For that, a basic understanding of R is required as well as installing R in your machines. I'll poste here some tutorials in case you need to learn basic R and links to where you can find R and R studio downloads. 

### 1. R installation and tutorials

In this section, I'll post to some useful links to download, install and learn R. You don't need to follow this if you have a basic understanding of R. If you need to learn R, I recomend that you do these tutorials little by little. For this week, you won't need to code in R yourself. Thus, I recomend that you space tutorials between this sesion and next and learn R gradually. However, it will be very helpfull for you if you learn the basics to understand what is going on. If you find some parts of the tutorial challenging or complicated, don't force yourself and skip those parts.

1. Downloading and installing R and R studio

    - This [link](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) contains lots of useful material to both install and learn R. Start clicking on the [R](https://cloud.r-project.org) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) in the previous link (or the ones I provide), download and install both in your machine. 

2. R tutorials

    - To get started, you can follow the [BasicBasics1](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-1/) brief tutorial of what are the different windows in Rstudio and the handy options produced by R-Ladies Sydney. I also recomend to watch the youtube [video](https://youtu.be/kfcX5DEMAp4).
           + In the BasicBasics 1 video, they talk about R Projects. Don't worry about that, we are not going to use them in this course. 
    
   - In the [education rstudio page](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) you will find that they (and I) recomend to follow chapter [*Getting Started with R and RStudio*](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-5-conclusion.html) (although the chapter is actually called *Getting Started with Data in R* on the webpage) from a book entitled *ModernDive*.

   - With this you should have enough to get started but, if you want more, you can find lots of other R courses and tutorials on internet. For example, I also recomend this [page](https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/r-code), especially the [Brief intro to R](https://whitlockschluter.zoology.ubc.ca/r-code/intror). 

2. Open MEGAX and import this data to MEGAX. This can be easily done dragging the file to the main MEGAX window or cliking on the **DATA** button. 
3. Click **MODELS** on the main MEGAX window and click **Find Best DNA/Protein Models (ML)...**
