# Friday Week40

## Work plan

The TA session is going to be streamed through zoom. The link is going to be posted in this week Material directory in Black Board 10-5 min before the TA starts. 

### 1. Wright-Fisher model simulations and Coalescence simulations

We are going to revise some of the concepts you learned during lectures from a more practical perspective: the Wright Fished model and the basics of Coalescence theory. You should start with the [Wright Fisher exercise](WrightFisherTutorial.md) and then, jump to the [coalescence exercise](CoalTutorial.md). These exercises are run in R.

### 2. Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 1, 2, 3

If there is time left, we will finish the book exercises.

Because the exercises can't be publicly distributed, you will find two links in this week's directory under the "Materials" section in Black Board, one for the exercises and the other for the google docs.

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf).
