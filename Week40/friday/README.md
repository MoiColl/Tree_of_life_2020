# Friday Week40

## Work plan

### 1. Wright-Fisher model simulations and Coalescence simulations

We are going to start by revising some of the concepts you learned during lectures. You should start with the [Wright Fisher exercise](WrightFisherTutorial.md) and then, jump to the [coalescence exercise](CoalTutorial.md). These exercises are run in R.

### 2. Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 1, 2, 3

If there is time left, we will finish the book exercises.

Because the exercises can't be publicly distributed, you will find two links in this week's directory under the "Materials" section in Black Board, one for the exercises and the other for the google docs.

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf).
