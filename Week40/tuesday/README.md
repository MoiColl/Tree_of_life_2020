# Tuesday Week40

## Work plan

### 1. Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 1, 2, 3

During this TA you will have time to answer the Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises, Chapter 1, 2, 3. Since it's quite some, try to do some work at home and leave the exercises you find more difficult to do in class. 

Because the exercises can't be publicly distributed, you will find two links in this week's directory under the "Materials" section in Black Board, one for the exercises and the other for the google docs.

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](#http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf)

### 2. Assignment discussion

We will try to comment the most common problems that I could find in the assingments and you will be able to ask questions that you might still have.

In case you are wandering about the homomtDNA dataset questions, here you have some papers that will give you the answer to those:

1. [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12788) describing the sequencing and analysis of the mtDNA from a speciment found in Sima de los Huesos

2. [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12788) describing the sequencing and analysis of the nuclear DNA from the same speciment found in Sima de los Huesos and comparison to the mtDNA results

3. [Journal article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/18/did-human-women-contribute-to-neanderthal-genomes-over-200000-years-ago) that talks about the finding
