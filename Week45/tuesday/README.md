# Tuesday Week45

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the genome duplication in vertebrates and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### Genome Duplication in Vertebrates

You should read this paper before Monday class:

Paramvir Dehal and Jeffrey L Boore. [Two Rounds of Whole Genome Duplication in the Ancestral Vertebrate](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030314). Plos Biology, 2005


Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QmwzVwh01Lg9H2RGIYQzNX78n4JndU_thSAnvAkHaxk/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions and they will have to write the answer that we all come up with.
