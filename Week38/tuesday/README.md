# Tuesday Week38 

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the insect phylogenetics paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### 1. The insect phylogenetics paper

You should read this paper before Tuesday class:

Michael W. Gaunt, Michael A. Miles, [An Insect Molecular Clock Dates the Origin of the Insects and Accords with Palaeontological and Biogeographic Landmarks, Molecular Biology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004133), Volume 19, Issue 5, May 2002, Pages 748â€“761

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q5oJ5cHrTUYxlvYSGcttUgEzaCcoqBDlsVc7eH04Vs/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions and they will have to write the answer that we all come up with.

Do you want to know more about the case? [Here](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/weekinreview/aids-and-a-dentist-s-secrets.html) is an article from the New York Times explaining the case, the multiple theories and what was believed at that time (June 6, 1993). You can also find more info about [David J. Acer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Acer) and patient A, [Kimberly Bergalis] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Bergalis). Furthemore, you can find other [publications](https://www.nature.com/articles/4808632) suporting the idea that David J. Acer intentionally infected their patients...

*to 'express a vendetta' against the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The scientist said Acer's principal motive was to seek revenge against the health agencies he believed infected homosexuals with AIDS during an experimental hepatitis B vaccination program in the 1970s.*
