# Tuesday Week38 

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the insect phylogenetics paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### 1. The insect phylogenetics paper

You should read this paper before Monday class:

Michael W. Gaunt, Michael A. Miles, [An Insect Molecular Clock Dates the Origin of the Insects and Accords with Palaeontological and Biogeographic Landmarks, Molecular Biology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004133), Volume 19, Issue 5, May 2002, Pages 748â€“761

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q5oJ5cHrTUYxlvYSGcttUgEzaCcoqBDlsVc7eH04Vs/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions and they will have to write the answer that we all come up with.
