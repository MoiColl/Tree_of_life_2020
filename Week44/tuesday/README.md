# Monday Week44

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the TLR2 selection paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### TLR2 selection paper

You should read this paper before Monday class:

B. TSCHIRREN, L. RABERG & H. WESTERDAHL. [Signatures of selection acting on the innate immunity gene Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) during the evolutionary history of rodents](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02254.x)., Bioinformatics, Volume 14, Issue 9, 1998, Pages 817â€“818

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6xW0EkTbhAqrklkqn6xUTP6SinH-qw09GR9VheC__Y/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions and they will have to write the answer that we all come up with.
