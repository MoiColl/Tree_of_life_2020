# Monday Week37

## Work plan

We are going to discuss the MODELTEST paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### MODELTEST algorithm paper

You should read this paper before Monday class:

D Posada, K A Crandall, [MODELTEST: testing the model of DNA substitution](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/14.9.817)., Bioinformatics, Volume 14, Issue 9, 1998, Pages 817â€“818

Before reading the paper, read G5. 

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ygITqDnkwMmNryhPJXiaiSWJ11gKVW0Z7GLjxUZ0lNU/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions and they will have to write the answer that we all come up with.
